A simple Corescript interpreter is very simple. For example, the following code:
```
print Hello
print World
```
Could be easily processed by this simple english code:
for line in code:
  if line starts with print:
    print substring(6, line)
Of course, a simple interpreter should have a lot more functionality than a print statement. Using substring will
will cut the string from the beginning to where the string starts. This includes the space after print.
